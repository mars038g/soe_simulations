abstract = { Due to the record high sea surface temperature anomalies in both the northeast Pacific and the region off Baja California and the development of the third largest El Ni{\~{n}}o this century, for the 2014 – 2015 period the California Current Ecosystem can be classified as lower productivity at almost every trophic level. Oceanographic conditions, represented by MEI, PDO and NPGO indices, indicated warmer conditions throughout.  The northern copepod index decreased off of Newport, indicating lower energy content for higher trophic levels.  High energy forage species were at low levels, while forage species with low and intermediate energy content were patchy; catches of young of the year rockfish and market squid were very high South of Cape Mendocino.  Pacific salmon faced additional stresses due to drought, warm weather, warm streams and 95{\%} below-normal snow-water equivalent storage.  Unusual mortality events for California sea lions and Guadalupe Fur Seals, as well as an unusually large, coast-wide common murre wreck, are further evidence of overall lower productivity in the California Current Ecosystem.  Commercial fishing landings remained high, driven mainly by landings of Pacific hake and coastal pelagic species.  Newly developed indicators of coastal community vulnerability show that fishery-dependent communities experienced increasing socioeconomic vulnerability from 2000 to 2010.},

abstract = {This report is structured to first provide an overview of why EBM is relevant today, the incentives that are making its implementation such a high priority in each PICES member country, and how EBM is being approached by each of the six member countries in the North Pacific. Section 2 tracks the progress toward developing ecosystem approaches, and while the primary focus is on fisheries as one of the most common economically and socially beneficial uses of the North Pacific ecosystem and one that may be a significant driver in ecosystem change, there are many other relevant human activities of importance to PICES countries in the North Pacific. These too are becoming part of the forward-looking evaluation of EBM. The next section of this report focuses on the development and utility of marine ecosystem indicators, which is currently an active research topic worldwide. This is connected with the increased interest in moving forward with EBM of marine resources, and recognition of the need to index and summarize the state of marine ecosystems. Section 4 focuses on identifying the spatial characteristics of North Pacific ecosystems, and how the different PICES member countries have incorporated these features into their management regimes. Because accounting for spatially explicit trends, processes and relationships is a main component of EBM, it follows that the spatial characteristics of marine ecosystems need to be identified in order to provide a context for identifying stakeholders, defining objectives, conducting research, and implementing policies focused on sustainable management of species, goods and services. The report concludes by presenting a brief overview summary of regional approaches to EBM, and their implications, and suggests relevant actions for PICES in the future, i.e., beyond the end of WG 19. It addresses the fact that while all EBM activities to date in the North Pacific are occurring within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of member countries, i.e., from the edge of each country's territorial sea (up to 12 nautical miles (22 km)) out to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coast, recent international conventions are beginning to focus development of EBM in international waters, i.e., beyond the EEZs.},

Management of the Earth's bio- diversity resources with the aim to reach the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity: the conservation and sustainable use of biological diver- sity, and the equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, presents a formidable challenge for humankind. The processes linking ecosystems and species are complex, and an action taken in one location may have unforeseen consequences elsewhere, often far away and many years later. In this context, the ecosystem approach offers a powerful strategy for the inte- grated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conserva- tion and sustainable use in an equitable way. The ecosystem approach is the pri- mary framework for action under the Convention, and its application will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention.},

Can simple be useful and reliable? Using ecological indicators to represent and compare the states of marine ecosystems. {\^{a}}€“ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 717{\^{a}}€“731. Within the IndiSeas WG, the evaluation of exploited marine ecosystems has several steps, from simple binary categorization of ecosystems to a more-complex attempt to rank them and to evaluate their status using decision-tree analyses. With the intention of communicating scientific knowledge to the public and stakeholders, focus is on evaluating and comparing the status of exploited marine ecosystems using a set of six ecological indicators and a simple and transparent graphic representation of ecosystem state (pie charts). A question that arose was whether it was acceptable to compare different types of marine ecosystems using a generic set of indicators. To this end, an attempt is made to provide reference levels to which ecosystems can be objectively compared. Unacceptable thresholds for each indicator are determined based on ecological expertise derived from a questionnaire distributed to a group of scientific experts. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed no significant difference in the thresholds provided for different ecosystem types, suggesting that it was reasonable to compare states directly across different types of ecosystem using the set of indicators selected.},

abstract = {This study investigated using Monte Carlo simulation the interaction between a linear trend and a lag-one autoregressive (AR(1)) process when both exist in a time series. Simulation experiments demonstrated that the existence of serial correlation alters the variance of the estimate of the Mann–Kendall (MK) statistic; and the presence of a trend alters the estimate of the magnitude of serial correlation. Furthermore, it was shown that removal of a positive serial correlation component from time series by pre-whitening resulted in a reduction in the magnitude of the existing trend; and the removal of a trend component from a time series as a first step prior to pre-whitening eliminates the influence of the trend on the serial correlation and does not seriously affect the estimate of the true AR(1). These results indicate that the commonly used pre-whitening procedure for eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test leads to potentially inaccurate assessments of the significance of a trend; and certain procedures will be more appropriate for eliminating the impact of serial correlation on the MK test. In essence, it was advocated that a trend first be removed in a series prior to ascertaining the magnitude of serial correlation. This alternative approach and the previously existing approaches were employed to assess the significance of a trend in serially correlated annual mean and annual minimum streamflow data of some pristine river basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that, with the previously existing procedures, researchers and practitioners may have incorrectly identified the possibility of significant trends.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems are characterized by many complex interactions. Fisheries managers face the challenge of maintaining or restoring sustainability for individual living resources which are affected by both ecological and economic interactions with other species, through processes like predation and fishing fleet interactions. These species interactions are further complicated by interactions with habitats that are changing due to both human activities and climate change. Often, fishery management systems designed to promote sustainability of individual resources have few tools or processes that also address interactions between species, fleets, habitat, and climate. Here, we review existing and potential fishery assessment and management information and tools, and we develop a potential framework for addressing interactions in management at the request of the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council. The structured framework can be used to first prioritize interactions, second specify key questions regarding high priority interactions, and third tailor appropriate analyses to address them. The primary tools for the initial steps in the framework are risk assessment and Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE). Finally, implemented management would be evaluated to ensure that objectives are being met, or to adjust measures as conditions change. In the final section, we outline an example to illustrate how a structured decision making process within the framework could work.},

abstract = {We develop a framework for the objective selection of a suite of indicators for use in fisheries management. The framework encompasses eight steps, and provides guidance on pitfalls to be avoided at each step. Step 1 identifies user groups and their needs, featuring the setting of operational objectives, and Step 2 identifies a corresponding list of candidate indicators. Step 3 assigns weights to nine screening criteria for the candidate indicators: concreteness, theoretical basis, public awareness, cost, measurement, historic data, sensitivity, responsiveness, and specificity. Step 4 scores the indicators against the criteria, and Step 5 summarizes the results. Steps 3-5 offer technical aspects on which guidance is provided, including scoring standards for criteria and a generalized method for applying the standards when scoring individual indicators. Multi-criterion summarization methods are recommended for most applications. Steps 6 and 7 are concerned with deciding how many indicators are needed, and making the final selection of complementary suites of indicators. Ordinarily, these steps are done interactively with the users of the indicators, thus providing guidance on process rather than technical approach. Step 8 is the clear presentation to all users of the information contained. The discussion also includes the special case in which indicators are used in formal decision rules.

abstract = {[1] Prewhitening has been used to eliminate the influence of serial correlation on the Mann-Kendall (MK) test in trend-detection studies of hydrological time series. However, its ability to accomplish such a task has not been well documented. This study investigates this issue by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulated time series consist of a linear trend and a lag 1 autoregressive (AR(1)) process with a noise. Simulation results demonstrate that when trend exists in a time series, the effect of positive/negative serial correlation on the MK test is dependent upon sample size, magnitude of serial correlation, and magnitude of trend. When sample size and magnitude of trend are large enough, serial correlation no longer significantly affects the MK test statistics. Removal of positive AR(1) from time series by prewhitening will remove a portion of trend and hence reduces the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be false. Contrarily, removal of negative AR(1) by prewhitening will inflate trend and leads to an increase in the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be true. Therefore, prewhitening is not suitable for eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test when trend exists within a time series.},

abstract = {Recent climate change due to global warming has given an impetus to trend analysis of hydrological time series. Climate change as well as low-frequency climate variability and human intervention in river basins violate the assumption of stationarity, which is claimed to be dead by some researchers. Detailed climate models and long hydrological records are needed to predict the future conditions in a changing world. It must be remembered, however, that all hydrological systems include a stationary element, at least in the form of a random component. A stationary model is sometimes preferable to a nonstationary one when the evolution in time of hydrological processes cannot be predicted reliably. It is attempted to generate synthetic nonstationary time series of future climates by means of a global climate model, which are then used in water resources optimization under uncertainty. The estimation of extremes (floods and low flows) is more important but also much more difficult. The statistical significance of a trend can be detected by means of statistical tests such as the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, which must be modified when there is serial correlation, possibly by prewhitening. Long-term persistence in hydrological processes also affects the results of the test. Some authors criticized the use of significance levels in statistical tests and recommended using confidence intervals around the estimated effect size. The power of a test depends on the chosen level of significance, sample size and the accuracy of prediction of trends. In some cases, it is more important to increase the power so that errors of estimation that may lead to damages due to inadequate protection are prevented. Frequency analysis of nonstationary processes can be made by fitting a trend to the parameters of the probability distribution. Annual maxima or peaks-over-threshold series can be analyzed incorporating a trend component to the parameters. Design concepts such as return period and hydrological risk should be redefined in a changing world. Design life level is another concept that can be used in a nonstationary context. In management decisions of water structures, a risk-based approach should be used where errors that result in under-preparedness are considered as well as those resulting in over-preparedness. In a changing world, decision making in water resources management requires long-term projections of hydrological time series that include trend due to anthropogenic intervention and climate change.},

Trend analysis of indicators: a comparison of recent changes in the status of marine ecosystems around the world. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 000-000. Time-series of ecological and exploitation indicators collected from 19 ecosystems were analysed to investigate whether there have been temporal trends in the status of fish communities. Using linear and non-linear statistical methods, trends are reported for six indicators (mean length of fish in the community, mean lifespan, proportion of predatory fish, total biomass of surveyed species, mean trophic level of landings, and inverse fishing pressure), and the redundancy of these indicators across ecosystems is evaluated. The expected direction of change for an ecosystem that is increasingly impacted by fishing is a decline in all indicators. A mixture of negative and positive directions of change is recorded, both within and among all ecosystems considered. No consistent patterns in the redundancy of the ecological indicators across ecosystems emerged from the analyses, confirming that each indicator provided complementary information on ecosystem status. The different trends in indicators may reflect differing historical exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in these systems. Commitment to monitoring programmes and development of system-specific baseline, target, and threshold reference levels are required. Improved understanding of the responsiveness and performance of ecological indicators to management actions are needed to address adequately whether ecosystems are recovering from, or being further impacted by, fishing, and whether management targets are being met. The relative effects of multiple environmental and ecological processes as well as multiple human-induced stressors that characterize exploited ecosystems also need to be quantified.},

abstract = {Ecosystems are complex and dynamic natural units that produce goods and services beyond those of benefit to fisheries. Because fisheries have a direct impact on the ecosystem, which is also impacted by other human activities, they need to be managed in an ecosystem context. The meaning of the terms “ecosystem management”, “ecosystem- based management”, “ecosystem approach to fisheries” (EAF), etc., are still not universally defined and progressively evolving. The justification of EAF is evident in the characteristics of an exploited ecosystem and the impacts resulting from fisheries and other activities. The rich set of international agreements of relevance to EAF contains a large number of principles and conceptual objectives. Both provide a fundamental guidance and a significant challenge for the implementation of EAF. The available international instruments also provide the institutional foundations for EAF. The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries is particularly important in this respect and contains provisions for practically all aspects of the approach. One major difficulty in defining EAF lies precisely in turning the available concepts and principles into operational objectives from which an EAF management plan would more easily be developed. The paper discusses these together with the types of action needed to achieve them. Experience in EAF implementation is still limited but some issues are already apparent, e.g. in added complexity, insufficient capacity, slow implementation, need for a pragmatic approach, etc. It is argued, in conclusion, that the future of EAF and fisheries depends on the way in which the two fundamental concepts of fisheries management and ecosystem management, and their respective stakeholders, will join efforts or collide.},

abstract = {A 15-year zooplankton time series collected off southern Vancouver Island (48-49°N) shows large interannual anomalies of biomass for most major zooplankton species. Variations within groups of ecologically similar species have been more extreme (often 10-fold or greater) than the variation in total biomass (four- to six-fold). For both total biomass and species groups, the zooplankton anomalies develop and persist over time spans of several years and are correlated across a large spatial scale ({\textgreater}100 km longshore). One dominant mode of recent zooplankton variation was a 1990-1998 cumulative shift to a more "southerly" copepod and chaetognath fauna: order-of-magnitude declines in several species endemic to the Northeast Pacific continental shelf and order-of-magnitude increases of species endemic to the California Current (35-45°N). This trend abruptly reversed in 1999. A second major mode of zooplankton variability consisted of roughly mirror-image fluctuations in the abundance of euphausiids versus subarctic oceanic copepods. Zooplankton anomalies were correlated with year-to-year changes in several physical environmental indices. The patterns of covariance suggest that zooplankton community composition responds strongly to ocean climate fluctuations and in particular to changing current patterns.},

Using indicators for evaluating, comparing, and communicating the ecological status of exploited marine ecosystems. 2. Setting the scene. {\^{a}}€“ ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 692{\^{a}}€“716. Background is provided to the selection of ecological indicators by the IndiSeas Working Group, and the methodology adopted for analysis and comparison of indicators across exploited marine ecosystems is documented. The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This is important because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data are available for complex and exhaustive analyses.},

abstract = {In many hydrological studies, two non-parametric rank-based statistical tests, namely the Mann-Kendall test and Spearman' s rho test are used for detecting monotonic trends in time series data. However, the power of these tests has not been well documented. This study investigates the power of the tests by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results indicate that their power depends on the pre-assigned significance level, magnitude of trend, sample size, and the amount of variation within a time series. That is, the bigger the absolute magnitude of trend, the more powerful are the tests; as the sample size increases, the tests become more powerful; and as the amount of variation increases within a time series, the power of the tests decrease. When a trend is present, the power is also dependent on the distribution type and skewness of the time series. The simulation results also demonstrate that these two tests have similar power in detecting a trend, to the point of being indistinguishable in practice. The two tests are implemented to assess the significance of trends in annual maximum daily streamflow data of 20 pristine basins in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that the P-values computed by these different tests are almost identical. By the binomial distribution, the field significant downward trend was assessed at the significance level of 0.05. Results indicate that a higher number of sites show evidence of decreasing trends than one might expect due to chance alone. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Comparing data-based indicators across upwelling and comparable systems for communicating ecosystem states and trends. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 807-832. A suite of ecological indicators was selected for communicating, in a comparable way, how fishing affects the state of several upwelling ecosystems and others in which small pelagic fish play key ecological roles. Detailed background and understanding of system-specific processes and changes is needed for proper interpretation of results. In particular, environmental forcing is important in driving dynamics in upwelling systems; fishing impacts cannot be understood without understanding the corresponding dynamics of the environment. The Saharan Coastal (Morocco) and southern Benguela, both having experienced upsurges in low-trophic-level species, differed from other ecosystems when considering indicator trends. The ecosystem off Portugal emerged as showing reduced signs of fishing impacts in recent years, although the change may also be reflecting climate change favouring recruitment and abundance of demersal stocks. The indicator suite confirmed general understanding that the Mediterranean ecosystems have been notably degraded for several decades. Results and conclusions from this descriptive synthesis are compared with other comparisons of more complex, model-derived indicators. Even in upwelling and comparable systems, the simple data-based indicators are useful in synthesizing information on the status of an ecosystem, in particular on the ecosystem effects of fishing, to provide an ecological diagnosis at the ecosystem level, to be used in decision-making. Indicators of recent ecosystem state and trends over time are needed to assess the effects of fishing, but more indicators measuring biodiversity attributes and environmental change would complement the suite, providing fuller assessment of the status of upwelling and comparable ecosystems.},

abstract = {Trends in Canadian temperature and precipitation during the 20th century are analyzed using recently updated and adjusted station data. Six elements, maximum, minimum and mean temperatures along with diurnal temperature range (DTR), precipitation totals and ratio of snowfall to total precipitation are investigated. Anomalies from the 1961-1990 reference period were first obtained at individual stations, and were then used to generate gridded datasets for subsequent trend analyses. Trends were computed for 1900-1998 for southern Canada (south of 60 degrees N), and separately for 1950-1998 for the entire country due to insufficient data in the high arctic prior to the 1950s. From 1900-1998, the annual mean temperature has increased between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees C in the south. The warming is greater in minimum temperature than in maximum temperature in the first half of the century resulting in a decrease of DTR. The greatest warming occurred in the west, with statistically significant increases mostly seen during spying and summer periods. Annual precipitation has also increased from 5{\%} to 35{\%} in southern Canada over the same period. In general, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has been increasing due mostly to the increase in winter precipitation which generally falls as snow and an increase of ratio in autumn. Negative trends were identified in some southern regions during spring. From 1950-1998, the pattern of temperature change is distinct: warming in the south and west and cooling in the northeast, with similar magnitudes in both maximum and minimum temperatures. This pattern is mostly evident in winter and spring. Across Canada, precipitation has increased by 5{\%} to 35{\%}, with significant negative trends found in southern regions during winter. Overall, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has increased with significant negative trends occurring mostly in southern Canada during spring. Indices of abnormal climate conditions are also examined. These indices were defined as areas of Canada for 1950-1998 or southern Canada for 1900-1998 with temperature or precipitation anomalies above the 66th or below the 34th percentiles in their relevant time series. These confirmed the above findings and showed that climate has been becoming gradually wetter and warmer in southern Canada throughout the entire century, and in all of Canada during the latter half of the century.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Monitoring to detect temporal trends in biological and habitat indices is a critical component of fisheries management. Thus, it is important that management objectives are linked to monitoring objectives. This linkage requires a definition of what constitutes a management-relevant ?temporal trend.? It is also important to develop expectations for the amount of time required to detect a trend (i.e., statistical power) and for choosing an appropriate statistical model for analysis. We provide an overview of temporal trends commonly encountered in fisheries management, review published studies that evaluated statistical power of long-term trend detection, and illustrate dynamic linear models in a Bayesian context, as an additional analytical approach focused on shorter term change. We show that monitoring programs generally have low statistical power for detecting linear temporal trends and argue that often management should be focused on different definitions of trends, some of which can be better addressed by alternative analytical approaches.},

An extension of the Mann-Kendall test for trend (designed for such data) is presented here. Because the test is based entirely on ranks, it is robust against nonnormality and censoring. Seasonality and missing values present no theoretical or computational obstacles to its application. Monte Carlo experiments show that, in terms of type I error, it is robust against serial correlation except when the data have strong long-term persistence (e.g., ARMA (1, 1) monthly processes with $\phi$ {\textgreater} 0.6) or short records 5 years). When there is no serial correlation, it is less powerful than a related simpler test which is not robust against serial correlation.},

For the last four decades, statistically significant changes in the seasonal extremes of SWH in the North Atlantic (NA) are detected only for the winter (January-March) season. These changes are found to be intimately connected with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO). To be specific, significant increases of SWH in the northeast NA, matched by significant decreases in the subtropical NA, are found to be associated with an intensified Azores high and a deepened Icelandic low. This is consistent with the findings of previous studies based on different datasets. Changes in seasonal extremes of SWH in the North Pacific (NP) are found to be statistically significant for the winter and spring (April-June) seasons. Significant increases in the extremes of SWH in the central NP are found to be connected with a deeper and eastward extended Aleutian low. For both oceans, no significant trends of SWH are detected for the last century, though significant changes are found in the last four decades. However, multidecadal fluctuations are very noticeable, especially in the North Pacific.},

abstract = {Size-based indicators are important tools for understanding how environmental variability and fishing impact on marine populations and communities. Ideally, they would standardise fishery-independent survey data. However, this is not possible in many of the world's ecosystems with important commercial fisheries. Using fishery-dependent data we investigated changes in the size-structure of pelagic catches off Northern Chile and whether or not these changes are influenced by the environment. We computed single- and multispecies, size-based fishery indicators (SBFIs) from 1990 to 2008 for the main commercial species, anchovy (Engraulis ringens), sardine (Sardinops sagax), jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) and mackerel (Scomber japonicus). SBFIs indicated a downward trend of body size in the catches taking all species together; a decrease of large sardine, an increase of small jack mackerel together with a decrease of larger sizes. Anchovy remained stable in body size and catch per unit of effort over the time period. Significant effects of the environment on mean length and catch per unit of effort were found for anchovy and sardine, respectively. We conclude that catches of pelagic species have shifted to smaller body sizes, with anchovy becoming the dominant species in the catches. We discuss the changes in the context of simultaneous, long-term, climate variability and fishing mortality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
